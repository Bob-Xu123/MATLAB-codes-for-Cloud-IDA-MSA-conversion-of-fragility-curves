# All three .m files are matlab script
example.m is a fragility conversion example (Cloud to IDA at extensive damage state).
frag_conversion.m is a fragility conversion function based on two fragility points.
IM_candidate.m is a function to obtain the IM candidates based on the original fragility curves.
